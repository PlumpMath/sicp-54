Suppose we deﬁne x and y to be two lists: 

(def x (list 1 2 3))
(def y (list 4 5 6))

What result is printed by the interpreter in response to evaluating each of the
following expressions:

(append x y)
; I'll use concat instead
(concat x y)
(1 2 3 4 5 6)

(cons x y)
((1 2 3) 4 5 6)

(list x y)
((1 2 3) (4 5 6))
