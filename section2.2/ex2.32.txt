We can represent a set as a list of distinct elements, and we can represent the
set of all subsets of the set as a list of lists. For example, if the set is
(1 2 3), then the set of all subsets is 
(() (3) (2) (2 3) (1) (1 3) (1 2) (1 2 3)). Complete the following deÔ¨Ånition of
a procedure that generates the set of subsets of a set and give a clear
explanation of why it works:

(defn subsets [s]
  (if (seq s)
    (let [r (subsets (rest s))]
      (concat r (map (partial cons (first s)) r)))
    (list '())))

(subsets '(1 2 3))
