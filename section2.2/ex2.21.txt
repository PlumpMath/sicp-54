The procedure square-list takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a
list of the squares of those numbers.

(square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
(1 4 9 16)

Here are two different deﬁnitions of square-list. Complete both of them by
ﬁlling in the missing expressions:

(defn square-list [items]
  (when (seq items)
    (cons (* (first items) (first items)) (square-list (rest items)))))

(defn square-list [items]
  (map #(* % %) items))
