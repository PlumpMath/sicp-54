Fill in the missing expressions to complete the following deÔ¨Ånitions of some
basic list-manipulation operations as accumulations:

(defn map* [p sequence]
  (lazy-seq
    (reduce #(conj %1 (p %2)) [] sequence)))

(defn append [seq1 seq2]
  (lazy-seq
    (reduce conj (vec seq1) seq2)))

(defn length [sequence]
  (reduce (fn [r _] (inc r)) 0 sequence))
