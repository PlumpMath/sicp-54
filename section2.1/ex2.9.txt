The width of an interval is half of the difference between its upper and lower
bounds. The width is a measure of the uncertainty of the number speciÔ¨Åed by the
interval. For some arithmetic operations the width of the result of combining
two intervals is a function only of the widths of the argument intervals, 
whereas for others the width of the combination is not a function of the widths
of the argument intervals. Show that the width of the sum (or difference) of
two intervals is a function only of the widths of the intervals being added 
(or subtracted).

Give examples to show that this is not true for multiplication or division.

(defn width [i]
  (/ (- (upper-bound i) (lower-bound i)) 2))

(defn width-sum [x y]
  (+ (width x) (width y)))

(defn width-sub [x y]
  (+ (width x) (width y)))

; proof that multiplication and division widths can't be calculated only
; as a function of widths
; if we can check that the same widths are used but the calculation returns
; different values, then we know that it must not be just a function of the
; widths

(width (mul-interval (make-interval 1 2) (make-interval 4 5)))

(width (mul-interval (make-interval 1 2) (make-interval 11 12)))
13/2

(width (div-interval (make-interval 1 2) (make-interval 4 5)))
7/20

(width (div-interval (make-interval 1 2) (make-interval 5 6)))
13/60

; the same widths were used for all intervals but the final width is 
; always different
