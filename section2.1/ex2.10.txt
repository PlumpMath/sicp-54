Ben Bitdiddle, an expert systems programmer, looks over Alyssa’s shoulder and
comments that it is not clear what it means to divide by an interval that spans
zero. Modify Alyssa’s code to check for this condition and to signal an error
if it occurs.

(defn div-interval [x y]
  (if (< 0 (width y))
    (throw (RuntimeException. "Cannot divide intervals that span 0"))
    (mul-interval x
                  (make-interval (/ 1.0 (upper-bound y))
                                 (/ 1.0 (lower-bound y))))))
