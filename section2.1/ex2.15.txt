Eva Lu Ator, another user, has also noticed the different intervals computed by
different but algebraically equivalent expressions. She says that a formula to
compute with intervals using Alyssa’s system will produce tighter error bounds
if it can be written in such a form that no variable that represents an
uncertain number is repeated. Thus, she says, par2 is a “better” program for
parallel resistances than par1. Is she right? Why?

Given this:

(par1 [2 3] [4 5])
[1.0 2.5]

(par2 [2 3] [4 5])
[1.3333333333333333 1.875]

We have to agree with Eva because the interval from par2 is tighter than the par1.
