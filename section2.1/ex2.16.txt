Explain, in general, why equivalent algebraic expressions may lead to different
answers. Can you devise an interval-arithmetic package that does not have this
shortcoming, or is this task impossible? (Warning: This problem is very difÔ¨Åcult.)

I have no answer to this but doing some googling I have found that there's an ongoing
specification definition on IEEE. So, at least some people think it's feasable.
