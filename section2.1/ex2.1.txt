Deﬁne a better version of make-rat that handles both positive and negative 
arguments. Make-rat should normalize the sign so that if the rational number
is positive, both the numerator and denominator are positive, and if the 
rational number is negative, only the numerator is negative.

(defn gcd [a b]
  (if (zero? b)
    a
    (recur b (rem a b))))

(defn make-rat [n d]
  (let [g (gcd n d)
        m (if (> (* n d) 0)
              1
              -1)]
    [(* m (/ (Math/abs n) g)) (/ (Math/abs d) g)]))
