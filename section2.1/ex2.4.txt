Here is an alternative procedural representation of pairs. For this 
representation, verify that (car (cons x y)) yields x for any objects x and y.

(defn cons* [x y]
  #(% x y))

(defn car* [z]
  (z (fn [p _] p)))

What is the corresponding deÔ¨Ånition of cdr? 
(Hint: To verify that this works, make use of the substitution model of Section 1.1.5.)

(defn cdr* [z]
  (z (fn [_ q] q)))

; I just run this at the repl and it works
