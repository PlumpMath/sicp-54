Alyssa’s program is incomplete because she has not speciﬁed the implementation
of the interval abstraction. Here is a deﬁnition of the interval constructor:

(defn make-interval [a b]
  [a b])

Deﬁne selectors upper-bound and lower-bound to complete the implementation.

(defn lower-bound [i]
  (first i))

(defn upper-bound [i]
  (second i))
