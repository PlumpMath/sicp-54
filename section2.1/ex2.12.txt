Deﬁne a constructor make-center-percent that takes a center and a percentage
tolerance and produces the desired interval. You must also deﬁne a selector
percent that produces the percentage tolerance for a given interval. The center
selector is the same as the one shown above.

(defn make-center-percent [c p]
  (let [w (/ (* c p) 100)]
    [(- c w) (+ c w)]))

(defn center [[s e]]
  (let [t (/ (- e s) 2)]
    (+ s t)))

(defn percent [[s e :as i]]
  (let [c (center i)]
    (/ (* (- e c) 100) c)))
