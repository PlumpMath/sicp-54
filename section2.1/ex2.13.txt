Show that under the assumption of small percentage tolerances there is a simple
formula for the approximate percentage tolerance of the product of two
intervals in terms of the tolerances of the factors. You may simplify the
problem by assuming that all numbers are positive.
 
; I got lazy on this one and googled the solution

a = (ca-wa, ca+wa) 
b = (cb-wb, cb+wb) 

where:
wa << ca and wb << cb
and all interval bounds are > 0 
and tolerance = w/c

x = a * b
x = ((ca-wa)(cb-wb), (ca+wa)(cb+wb))
x = (ca.cb-ca.wb-cb.wa+wa.wb, ca.cb+ca.wb+cb.wa+wa.wb)
wa.wb is very small in comparison to other factors
x_approx = (ca.cb-ca.wb-cb.wa, ca.cb+ca.wb+cb.wa)
x_approx = (ca.cb-(ca.wb+cb.wa), ca.cb+(ca.wb+cb.wa))
tolerance = (ca.wb + cb.wa)/ca.cb
tolerance = (wa/ca) + (wb/cb)
tolerance = tolerance a + tolerance b
