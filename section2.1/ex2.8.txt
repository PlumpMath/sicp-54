Using reasoning analogous to Alyssa’s, describe how the difference of two
intervals may be computed. 
Deﬁne a corresponding subtraction procedure, called sub-interval.

let's see:

5 - 3 = 2 ; both with .5 tolerance

[4.5 5.5] - [2.5 3.5] ; this should return [1 3] to maximise the interval

so:

[a1 a1] - [b1 b2] must be [a1-b2 a1-b1]

and:

(defn sub-interval [x y]
  (make-interval
    (- (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y))
    (- (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y))))
