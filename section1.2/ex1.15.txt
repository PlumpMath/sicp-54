The sine of an angle (speciﬁed in radians) can be computed by making use of the approximation sin x = x if x is sufﬁciently small, and the trigonometric identity

sin x = 3 sin x / 3 - 4 sin^3 x / 3

to reduce the size of the argument of sin. (For purposes of this exercise an angle is considered “sufﬁciently small” if its magnitude is not greater than 0.1 radians.)
These ideas are incorporated in the following procedures:

(defn cube [x] 
  (* x x x))

(defn p [x] 
  (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(defn sine [angle]
  (if-not (> (abs angle) 0.1)
    angle
    (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

a. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?


(sine 12.15)

(p (sine 4.05))

(p (p (sine 1.35)))

(p (p (sine 0.45)))

(p (p (p (sine 0.15))))

(p (p (p (p (sine 0.05)))))

4 times


b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a) used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

constant in space and log a in number of steps as at each step the angle is divided by 3
