The following pattern of numbers is called Pascal’s triangle.

    1
   1 1
  1 2 1
 1 3 3 1
1 4 6 4 1

The numbers at the edge of the triangle are all 1, and each number inside the triangle is the sum of the two numbers above it.
Write a procedure that computes elements of Pascal’s triangle by means of a recursive process.

(defn bin-coef [n]
  (if (= n 0) 
    '(1)
    (flatten [1  (map + (bin-coef (dec n)) (rest (bin-coef (dec n)))) 1])))
