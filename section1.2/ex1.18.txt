Using the results of Exercise 1.16 and Exercise 1.17, devise a procedure that generates an iterative process for multiplying two integers in terms of adding, 
doubling, and halving and uses a logarithmic number of steps.

(defn my* [a b]
  (loop [a a b b result 0]
    (cond
      (= b 0)result
      (even? b) (recur (twice a) (halve b) result) 
      :else (recur a (dec b) (+ result a)))))
