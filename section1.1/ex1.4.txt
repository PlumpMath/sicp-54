Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are compound expressions.
Use this observation to describe the behavior of the following procedure:

(defn a-plus-abs-b [a b]
  ((if (> b 0)
     +
     -) a b))

as the name of the function states, this will add to a the absolute value of b.
