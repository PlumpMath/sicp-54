Let f and g be two one-argument functions. The composition f after g is 
deﬁned to be the function x -> f (g (x)).
Deﬁne a procedure compose that implements composition. For example, if inc
is a procedure that adds 1 to its argument, 

((compose square inc) 6)

(defn compose [& fns]
  (fn [x]
    (reduce #(%2 %1) x (reverse fns))))
