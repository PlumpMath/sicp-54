A continued fraction representation of the tangent function was published in 
1770 by the German mathematician J.H. Lambert:

tan x = x / (1 - (x^2 / (3 - (x^2 / (5 - ... 

where x is in radians. Deﬁne a procedure (tan-cf x k) that computes an 
approximation to the tangent function based on Lambert’s formula. 
k speciﬁes the number of terms to compute, as in Exercise 1.37.

(defn cont-frac [n d k]
  (letfn [(acc [n d k result]
            (println result)
            (if (= 1 k)
              (- 1 result)
              (recur n d (dec k) (/ (n k) (- (d k) result)))))]
    (acc n d k 0)))

(defn tan-cf [x k]
  (/ x 
    (cont-frac
      (fn [_] (* x x))
      (fn [i] (dec (* 2 i)))
      k)))
